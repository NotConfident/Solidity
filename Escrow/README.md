# Escrow

When swapping for a token with low liquidity, it often leads to high slippage which moves the price drastically in either direction. This is an expected behaviour in DEXs which is undesirable, as we are not able to buy / sell these tokens at its 'true price' - similar to an CEX.

This project experiments with the idea of creating a time-based contract that locks in both party's assets at the 'true price' agreed outside of this contract, and allows for a trustless (via smart contracts) swap (transferring tokens) without any slippage.

Inspired from an attempted swap with that resulted in a high slippage. P2P attempts are unreliable as its solely based on trust (high risk, including untrusted middleman) ðŸ¥²

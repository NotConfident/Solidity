Each Tiny Astros NFT have the ability to rent (or "gift) out 1 additional pass to another user / friend possibly at a price. However, there is no such platform to faciliate such agreement between users. There is a lack of a "marketplace" for users to offer their passes for the masses to see.

This prototype explores the possibility of creating a smart contract to bridge the gap between Renters (Tiny Astro Holders with additional passes to rent out), and users who wish to Rent a pass at a price and facilitates it.
